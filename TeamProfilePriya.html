      <h3 style="color:blue;">Priya's Personal Information </h3>      
      <p>I am Priya Mathew, currently I am studying at RMIT and my student ID is s3925824 and my email id is: s3925824@student.rmit.edu.au.
	 A curious fascination of mine has been the digital world I am an active participant in. 
	 I have always been intrigued by how efficiently and effectively the world of IT works, and wished to be an active contributor to it. 
	 The idea of data analytics, especially of how the everyday data that has been collected “voluntarily” from customers,
	 like me through our daily interactions online, is then being used by large and small enterprises to determine marketing strategies,
	 research policies and even develop prediction softwares that can accurately analyse how we will vote. 
	 This curiosity has led me to seek out  a career in IT, and has also influenced my approach to IT,
	 and has been the key determinant in cultivating my interest in pursuing this subject academically, 
	 even though I only possess limited prior experience with Information Technology overall.</p>

      <p><strong>Priya's test results</strong></p>
      <p> Myers-Briggs test: ENFP-A, this results identifies my personality to possess strong people skills, 
	  and as such I will be able to utilise this skills in communicating my ideas within my team effectively,
	  while actively listening to the inputs from my team members and building a suitable solution that satisfies the demands of the work and team.
	  Whereas the Learning Styles Test displays that I show equal amount of importance to both the activist style,
	  at the same time also portraying an equal strength in the reflector style,
	  this had made me understand that I am able to show leadership qualities when needed,
	  but also show emapathy in regards to the ideas presented by others.
	  This I believe will be beneficial in keeping a healthy dynamics between members of different temperaments
	  in a team enviornment.
	  And the Verbal Reasoning Test indicates that I tend to excel in accurately reviewing verbal data and coming to logical conclusions.
	  These assessments have aided me in reflecting about my own work style and form an idea that I work well with others of differing working styles.
	  Considering the results of my assessments it indicates that I can be pragmatic and also am
	  someone who can enthusiastically adapt to a team of individuals of varying personalities.
	  However,I will most likely work best with other individuals who are able to work autonomously with their specific tasks, 
	  yet are also able to contribute equally in collectively building ideas.</p>
      <h4 style="color:blue;">Ideal Job - Customer Engineer/Technical Sales Engineer</h4>
      <p> My ideal job would be to work as a Customer Engineer, as I find this appealing for multiple reasons,
	  firstly because in this role I will get to engage with customers directly and work together with them,
	  to deliver solutions specifically addressing their requirements. 
	  This is good for me according to my personality test results, I showcase strong communications and analytical skills.
	  It will require me to also have a strong technical understanding of but not limited to coding in python and or java,
	  as well as business analysis and business management skills.
	  Along side general skills such as communication and trouble-shooting and team work.</p>
