        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Are you wanting to create an anonymous world, one where you can browse and surf your social media sites anonymously without the worry of cookies and trackers observing your every key stroke, pause and ad-clicks? Burning Apple has decided to develop an app Freed.OM (Freedom from Online Monitoring) that is able to hide user data when surfing the web or using social media platforms like Facebook and its affiliates. Users who have activated the app are able to browse their favourite websites and social media as usual, but the app then creates multiple duplications of the relevant site from various locations globally, that randomly generate activity on the users account, mimicking data usage most common in that localised region, therefore corrupting the accuracy of data and thus rendering it unusable. Thereby, creating an anonymous browsing experience for the end user, without having to sacrifice social interaction. Meanwhile the user’s - real online activity that may be collected through cookies and trackers are simultaneously being erased from the local cache, so it becomes harder for specific, targeted data collection and monitoring of users. Using and supporting Burning Apple helps support the freedom of expression for our users from around the world.</p>
        <h3>Motivation
        <p>The motivation for this project was that one of the biggest threats for individuals nowadays is their data being collected. Specifically, the way it is collected, stored and utilized by social media giants such as Facebook and its associated and affiliated technologies (Review.org 2020). Data collection isn’t necessarily the issue here though, it’s more so unwanted data collection or data collection in which you aren’t aware of. It has been reported that the Cambridge Analytica Scandal revealed that as many as 87million people’s data had been harvested. (The New York Times, 2018) However currently there is no sustainable or feasible alternative besides completely disconnecting, quitting and removing all forms of interactions in the digital world. Yet in order to be an active member of today’s digital society, going off- grid is no longer an option, there is a strong need for a more practical and effective alternative, it has become a necessity of the times. Thus, burning apple was conceived. Where burning apple differs from other like-minded competitors is its multiple purpose functionality as well as being free for the user. Unlike other similar products that charge subscription fees or whatever.
        <h3>Outcome
        <p>If this project were to be implemented, this will undoubtedly change how social media works and go on to give users the ability to control and ultimately limit the harvesting of data for individuals. It may provide users with the peace of mind and reassurance the current social media platforms have failed to provide. (Hootsuite2021). As such this App will disrupt the way large platforms work and it could lead to more conversations and promote legislations that focus priority in maintaining transparency and strict oversight over the usage of data mining practices. This project will essentially bring about a new age for how the resource of data works and can be utilised without compromising on individual privacy. This intern will increase human wellbeing throughout its userbase. 
        <h3>Skills
        <p>In order to bring this project to fruition we mostly will need many persons from various different aspects of IT fields, to work with us to develop and build and maintain the application to be able to make this a feasible and marketable application, that may be accessible and usable for the digitally challenged, especially the older generation who are not tech savvy.  Initially it will require software developers with prior experience in creating portals, with multiple functionalities, such as but not limited to email storage, automated response implementation, deletion of local cache, operation of duplication sites, notification settings, alerts systems and real time updates. (Mathew, P 2021)
It will need a minimum of at the least a member of the team to be able to bring with them a significant amount of experience in managing and successfully bringing to life marketing campaigns as well as a varied skill-set including but in no way limited to the technical skills such as  SEO optimisation skills so clients and able to make use of and therefore be made aware and propagate the product to others.(Mathew, P 2021) It will also require multiple computer engineers with extensive skills in create embedded hardwares with multi-factor authentications as part of the team, as they will be dealing with multiple units of computing hardware as well as portable storage units with high capacities, and these aspects will require constant monitoring as this part of the team will need to be increased once we will expand the project to  to be involve and develop to local servers and possibly multiple TOR relay nodes in at least 10 -15 locations globally, or in the markets with the highest usage. And we will need investors who are able to bring in significant capital in order to acquire a bulk VPN to further accelerate the duplication processes of social media sites.
        <h3>Description
        <p>Working off the ideas presented in Assignment 1(Mathew, P 2021), as well as the feedback, as a group we discussed the feasibility of the project, and if we were to implement it what would be the likely tools and technology we will require. As advised from the feedback, there are already tools similar to the application we are considering to create that do aim to provide similar output. This project aims to create a simple tool, that requires minimal skills from the end user, so they may also be able to use social media privately without having their data tracked. And as such for this project we will create an app to be industrialised by utilising either the MIT App Inventor, or we may 
require an individual who may possess the necessary skill, to be part of the group, who will be significantly accomplished in a major developing language with expertise in both front-end and back-end platform development. It will necessitate a TOR relay( CSO Online 2019) to maneuver and successfully deliver the copying and transmitting of data through and through assorted networks. It will certainly also involve for us to be acquiring and maintaining a number of local servers in at least 10 – 15 locations, at the least. At the start, with a modest user list, these could be achieved by using the cloud storage system and depending on the user’s own device hardware, or multiple external hardwares connected and step up to constantly be running on local devices. 
        <h3>Tools+Tech
        <p>The app will create a new digital environment that facilitates the active participation of users in social media platforms without compromising their rights to privacy. Freed.om will provide users with hassle free experiences online, while retaining their anonymity, thereby reducing the amount of data accumulated on individuals. This app’s true originality lies in its approach in the utilization of the technologies of the modern era without causing lasting detrimental effects to the freedom and privacy of every person using them. Irrespective of whether they utilize the app or not, essentially the harvested data will be deemed to be of little value due the vastness of the corrupted data. 
Until the present there haven't been many applications that have taken advantage of the already present cookies and trackers to circumvent and deliberately corrupt the process of data gathering implemented by platforms such as Facebook. This project will create an application that will efficiently and effectively aid and enable end users the freedom to browse, interact and access these resources and maintain a digital presence without having to compromise on their most valuable asset- data and as such this project will truly become an innovative and novel invention. 
This project aims to address the missing component that is causing grave concerns for a large section of the society, who wish to explore an alternative to the current practices of social media usage. It must be noted that in a recent survey that was carried out on whether the general user trusts Facebook in keeping their information secure, a surprisingly phenomenal number of individuals stated that do not trust the platform, that is 47% of Facebook users, who responded that they do not believe the tech giant securely protect their data, while 23% of those who do trust Facebook, only do so “somewhat”. (Hootsuite 2021). With such a staggeringly high rate of distrust, this app will become a significant and necessary alternative. 
The functionality of this app will be made possible by creating a portal in which the users allow all communication with social media platforms be directed to their inbox. There they will then activate the plug-in that will provide an automated response to all sign -in queries and location notifications generated by the duplication logins to be confirmed. However this app will closely monitor any communication that references location that was not generated by the app, and will create specific alerts for users to confirm any unusual logins and ensure safety for hacking. Meanwhile an alternate application will run continuous clearing of the local cache so the stored metadata of the user will be harder to gather and thus resulting in an added privacy veil. 
For this project, the app will be in a similar functioning process style to how VPN and TOR combinations of IP-securing work, however with a very different aim and methodology. The key goal will be to retain as much privacy as possible. In order for this app to be created, these essential artifacts will be necessary, a repository of randomly generated browser routes, making use of TOR’s web traffic anonymisation proxy, while simultaneously making use of a large scale, as well as numerous VPN stimulated connections, in order to generate enough duplications to cause a significant corruption to the data collected will be a minimum requisite. 
The general feasibility of this project is limited by the ability to raise the initial investment required, and the continued development of the project is possible by charging users for the services. As the current climate indicates, the growing number of users who utilise the services of paid VPN services have risen and the number of service providers has also increased(One Zero 2019).
