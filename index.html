        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Are you wanting to create an anonymous world, one where you can browse and surf your social media sites anonymously without the worry of cookies and trackers observing your every key stroke, pause and ad-clicks? Burning Apple has decided to develop an app Freed.OM (Freedom from Online Monitoring) that is able to hide user data when surfing the web or using social media platforms like Facebook and its affiliates. Users who have activated the app are able to browse their favourite websites and social media as usual, but the app then creates multiple duplications of the relevant site from various locations globally, that randomly generate activity on the users account, mimicking data usage most common in that localised region, therefore corrupting the accuracy of data and thus rendering it unusable. Thereby, creating an anonymous browsing experience for the end user, without having to sacrifice social interaction. Meanwhile the userâ€™s - real online activity that may be collected through cookies and trackers are simultaneously being erased from the local cache, so it becomes harder for specific, targeted data collection and monitoring of users. Using and supporting Burning Apple helps support the freedom of expression for our users from around the world.</p>
