        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Are you wanting to create an anonymous world, one where you can browse and surf your social media sites anonymously without the worry of cookies and trackers observing your every key stroke, pause and ad-clicks? Burning Apple has decided to develop an app Freed.OM (Freedom from Online Monitoring) that is able to hide user data when surfing the web or using social media platforms like Facebook and its affiliates. Users who have activated the app are able to browse their favourite websites and social media as usual, but the app then creates multiple duplications of the relevant site from various locations globally, that randomly generate activity on the users account, mimicking data usage most common in that localised region, therefore corrupting the accuracy of data and thus rendering it unusable. Thereby, creating an anonymous browsing experience for the end user, without having to sacrifice social interaction. Meanwhile the user’s - real online activity that may be collected through cookies and trackers are simultaneously being erased from the local cache, so it becomes harder for specific, targeted data collection and monitoring of users. Using and supporting Burning Apple helps support the freedom of expression for our users from around the world.</p>
        <h3>Motivation
        <p>The motivation for this project was that one of the biggest threats for individuals nowadays is their data being collected. Specifically, the way it is collected, stored and utilized by social media giants such as Facebook and its associated and affiliated technologies (Review.org 2020). Data collection isn’t necessarily the issue here though, it’s more so unwanted data collection or data collection in which you aren’t aware of. It has been reported that the Cambridge Analytica Scandal revealed that as many as 87million people’s data had been harvested. (The New York Times, 2018) However currently there is no sustainable or feasible alternative besides completely disconnecting, quitting and removing all forms of interactions in the digital world. Yet in order to be an active member of today’s digital society, going off- grid is no longer an option, there is a strong need for a more practical and effective alternative, it has become a necessity of the times. Thus, burning apple was conceived. Where burning apple differs from other like-minded competitors is its multiple purpose functionality as well as being free for the user. Unlike other similar products that charge subscription fees or whatever.
        <h3>Outcome
        <p>If this project were to be implemented, this will undoubtedly change how social media works and go on to give users the ability to control and ultimately limit the harvesting of data for individuals. It may provide users with the peace of mind and reassurance the current social media platforms have failed to provide. (Hootsuite2021). As such this App will disrupt the way large platforms work and it could lead to more conversations and promote legislations that focus priority in maintaining transparency and strict oversight over the usage of data mining practices. This project will essentially bring about a new age for how the resource of data works and can be utilised without compromising on individual privacy. This intern will increase human wellbeing throughout its userbase.
