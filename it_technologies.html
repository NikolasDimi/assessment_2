      <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
      <p>Raspberry Pi’s production started in 2011, which was developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation with the involvement and knowledge from Broadcom. Raspberry Pi foundation were promoting their products towards undeveloped countries and for students to learn programing, however, they didn’t anticipate their models to gain traction in other areas of the Information Technology industry and now Raspberry Pi units are widely used because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. This has made Raspberry Pi one to the most salable computer parts in the world. Nevertheless, its usage started to expand in numerous fields in the technology industry. It is now rather common to meet countless individuals who are using Raspberry Pi boards in their homes to utilise functions like weather reporting or online radio listening. It has also become popular for educational institutes to stock these units for the intention of students to learn programming. <br>
The Raspberry Pi plugs into a computer monitor or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games. <br>
The overwhelming use of the Raspberry Pi is, obviously, for instructive purposes. This incorporates both equipment and programming, in a scope of instructive and examination offices, a large number of different distributions remembered for this Special Issue address explicit patterns. For instance, with the accessibility of minimal expense processing, we are seeing an adjustment of structures, whereby figuring is pushed towards the edge of the organization. This Fog or Edge registering is a significant change that is needed to make IoT frameworks more proficient and versatile. Scaling to billions of gadgets may be conceivable in case power is utilized proficiently through streamlined figuring and clever observing frameworks. This will affect the climate where we reside. Understanding environmental change, contamination and other natural issues can profit from IoT gadgets that action and log boundaries. <br>
With the production of tremendous quantities of IoT gadgets, elective systems administration models, procedures and instruments are required; one device around here of examination is network proving grounds. These proving grounds assist span the universes of unadulterated recreation with trial plan. Actual proving grounds can be expensive, making Raspberry Pi-based arrangements more appealing. <br>
The Internet of things incorporates all parts of the computerized world and the communication with actual frameworks, for instance workmanship, modern, clinical examination and auto applications. As gadgets become implanted across the foundations of civilizations, more effective fixes are needed for geo-area, remote and cross section network advancements, in-situ picture preparing and multi-specialist frameworks <br>
Indeed, even in distant districts, Raspberry Pi gadgets are utilized for checking and breaking down the circadian and ultradian locomotors movement of little marine spineless creatures. <br>
The Raspberry Pi is an amazing prototyping stage, the possibility of a model suggests a fractional execution of the relative multitude of wanted components, yet there is frequently a need to construct a completely useful model. <br>
There are two main reasons to build a prototype:
•	to test and validate an idea or hypotheses. This follows the failure fast design philosophy where it is best to identify the good and bad ideas early. Building a prototype in a matter of days is acceptable even if it is too big, expensive, consumes too much power and is a bit slow, if it provides a mechanism to prove or disprove the feasibility of an idea.
•	to validate hardware design. Before commissioning a large production run or fully optimizing a design, a prototype can be used to validate the electronic design and sensor capabilities within a desired operating environment. <br>
The Raspberry Pi is an ideal platform for this as it is commodity hardware, supports high-level programming languages (e.g., Python) and runs popular variants of Unix-like operating systems. <br>
The craving to fabricate IoT gadgets has never been more grounded, and the scope of makers is just about as wide as it has been at any point ever, presently not passed on to a small bunch of enormous innovation organizations. There is a movement way for on-premises endeavor applications to relocate to cloud-based suppliers, and the equivalent is valid for Raspberry Pi based applications. Different cloud facilitating organizations offer completely oversaw Raspberry Pi equipment in business server farms, Platform As A Service (PAAS). <br>
Buying a Raspberry Pi in a server farm might appear to be somewhat peculiar as it is absurd to expect to add extra equipment (e.g., sensors) and is a fairly helpless performing web server. In any case, it bodes well for every one of the large numbers of individuals who purchased the gadgets for schooling, and in this way evolved applications. The Raspberry Pi depends on an ARM design, the most recent is ARMv8. Relocating applications isn't double viable with different designs, so just replicating incorporated records to a x86/x64 cloud facilitated server won't work. A facilitated Raspberry Pi is OS and equipment indistinguishable from those bought in their millions, subsequently arrangement documents and paired record replicating are upheld. According to schooling point of view, making a custom application accessible freely doesn't need port planning, dynamic DNS or a comprehension of processor structures. As these applications develop and need seriously preparing power, one redesign way could be to relocate to an ARM based server rather that moving designs. This is with regards to a rising pattern to remember ARM based servers for server farms. <br>
A freely addressable Raspberry Pi requires a web address yet IPv4 addresses are expanding in cost, possibly equaling the expense of the genuine equipment. The ideal opportunity for IPv6 is here, some facilitated Raspberry Pi contributions right now just help IPv6 (with IPv4 port sending as a fall-back). IPv6 offers more proficient steering, easier arrangement and better security; it additionally dispenses with the requirement for NAT, private IP tending to and its related issues. A climate which makes IPv6 the default choice must be invited and guarantees a future sealing of abilities in the future. <br>
In 2015, the 194 nations of the United Nations General Assembly took on the 2030 Development Agenda which traces 17 Sustainable Development Goals each with an unmistakable arrangement of targets. These are intended to advance worldwide maintainability on the grounds that, in the expressions of the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon '... there is no Plan B since we don't have a Planet B ...'. These objectives are painstakingly explored and broadly upheld; all the more critically, the IoT insurgency is a key empowering agent to accomplishing these objectives. <br>
The 'Web of Things Declaration to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals' taken on in 2017 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and different partners, characterizes 10 exercises which endeavor to advance worldwide discourse and participation for development in the Internet of Things: <br>
1.	Promoting the development and adoption of IoT technologies for the benefit of humanity, the environment and sustainable development.
2.	Supporting the implementation of the IoT in urban and rural context to foster the application of ICTs in providing services to build smarter and more sustainable cities and communities.
3.	Promoting a broad, vibrant and secure ecosystem for IoT, including support for start-ups and incubators.
4.	Encouraging the development and implementation of standards that facilitate interoperability among IoT technologies and solutions in order to pave the way to an open and interoperable IoT ecosystem
5.	Adopting new and innovative IoT applications to deal with challenges associated with hunger, water supply, and food security
6.	Galvanizing interest in the use of IoT for risk reduction and climate change mitigation
7.	Identifying and supporting the growing trend of using IoT technologies for education
8.	Embracing the application and use of IoT for biodiversity conservation and ecological monitoring
9.	Contributing to global research and discussions on IoT for smart and sustainable cities through global initiatives
10.	Promoting international dialogue and cooperation on IoT for sustainable development<br>
These ten exercises guide to the Sustainable Development Goals as displayed in to give solid proof that IoT arrangements will affect every one of the main worldwide issues confronting our human advancements. <br>
We presume that the Raspberry Pi is a teacher and empowering agent of thoughts that will have an effect at a worldwide level, spreading over numerous disciplines and financial classes. Your everyday person now has access to low-cost computer board. The greatest effect that the Raspberry Pi has had is to cause the innovation behind PCs to appear to be more available. There are near 20 million Raspberry Pis out there on the planet. There may influence a tiny level of the total populace, yet that little rate has the ability to affect the whole world. <br>

      <h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible? </strong></h4>
      <p>An autonomous vehicle can be defined as having one or more aspects of control (such as acceleration, breaking or steering) being performed by the vehicle rather than the driver (VicRoads). Autonomous vehicles should however be thought of as more of a range rather than a category. This range is between 0 and 5 with 0 being no automation and 5 being full automation. As of right now, we only have at maximum stage 3 autonomy (situational autonomy) on the market. However, that is only under certain conditions. For example, it must be day, well light up, clear weather, well mapped out area and there needs to be another car within a certain distance in front just to name a few. However, most autonomous vehicles on the market fall within stage 1 or 2. Within the next few years, it is unlikely there will be drastic improvements to autonomous vehicles. The closer towards full autonomy we get, the harder it becomes to improve. As for what technological or other developments make this possible, there are a few. In order for full autonomy to take place, there would need to be some sort of decision making involved. For example, if the vehicle was put into a position where it would either crash into someone or was forced to crash into some other object instead to avoid hitting that person, a decision on what to do would have to be made. Another development that would be necessary for allowing autonomous vehicles on the road legally would be a change in the laws.
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></h4>
      <p>The likely impact of the advancements in autonomous vehicles is that people would gravitate towards them. Meaning in the long term, basically every car would be self-driving. A potential impact of this development would be laws and regulation put in place to allow for fully autonomous vehicles on the road. And there may possibly be a future where it would be illegal for a non-autonomous vehicle to be on the road. As autonomous vehicle technology improves, some jobs may become redundant. An example of such job would be a taxi driver. If it were the case that you could simply tell or instruct a vehicle on where to go, and it take you there, what would be the need of having someone driver you there themselves.  The people most affected by this technology would firstly be those capable or purchasing one. Technically we already have low level autonomous vehicles with things such as cruise control or lane departure detection. So, the argument could be made that these people have already been affected by this technology rather than will be. As for higher levels of autonomy though. The people affected would be skewed towards the wealthy in the short term. How they would be affected by this would be simply not being involved in the driving process.
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</strong></h4>
      <p>In terms of how this will affect me, it wouldn’t be as much when compared to someone else who uses cars more frequently. However if it were the case that I did have access to this technology, I would be more  willing to get on the road knowing that I’m not the one controlling the vehicle (I think that autonomous vehicles would be a much safer driver than me) as well as the fact that there would be less people on the road (other people suck at driving, or at least the people I tend to share the road with). Advancements in this technology will not really affect my daily life. The only difference would literally be that I would be more likely to go somewhere. This technology is much more likely to have a greater effect on family/ friends as I barely use a car. Whereas they (most) use a car daily in order to get to and from work/school or wherever they felt like going. The differences this technology will have on their lives could be that it may take less time to go from one place to another. Assuming all autonomous vehicles knew where each other were involved in some hive mind like technology, there would really be no need for traffic lights, and the speed limit may be increased as safety would already be greatly increased by the technology. I’m not saying that safety would be increased to a point where it wouldn’t be a concern, just to clarify. What I mean is that things such as the speed limit could be increased assuming that things such as other drivers bad driving and the human reaction time were no longer involved in driving.

      <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving sector of the IT world. As such there are many different technologies that are being developed on a daily basis to counter all forms of malicious cyber attacks. The key new technologies that will be further developed will most likely be Behavioural Analytics which is used to identity user patterns across a platform and if and when they may be an upsurge of activity, that is previously undetected, the analytics will thereby classify this as a possible attempt for a potential breach occurring and thus limit and or stop completely any phishing attempts or data hacks. Another key technology that is currently being generated is the use of Embedded authenticators with hardware. This process will ensure a more reliable system that maybe be impregnable from outside threats, as this will require additional layers of authentication from a principal physical device (such as a token) held by an approved user, alongside a password protection process, to access any computer or network resources.(Cyber Degrees 2021)
      <br>
      <p>Currently, the Intel corporation (Intel 2021) has developed a new advancement in the aspect of Embedded authenticators within the hardware component of computers and other network systems. This technology will expand the development of two factor(2FA) and multi factor authentication (MFA) in a process that will make hacking near impossible as external access to the hardware is restricted due to lack of approachability in most cases. This is comparable to a nuclear silo and the nuclear code separation system needed to laugh any of the connected silos, by implementing the same methodology, the embedded authenticates will be much harder to attack.  Thus, this will require minimal additional softwares to be developed, as in most cases hackers adapt and are able to quickly modify their programes to either bypass or manipulate the software restrictions implemented. Whilst the Behavioural Analytics technology using user data, is currently utilised mostly by social media sites such as Facebook in identifying user interests, this can be adapted to be broaden across multiple platforms including governmental sites to accurately regulate if there is any unusual activity. This will utilise technologies such as Artificial Intelligence(AI) to classify and log generic user activity and cross-reference these across the users many online activities.(Incognito Forensic Foundation n.d) And thereby catalogue these collected data into a structured data map that may be compared to in real time with Deep Learning technologies, thus eliminating human interference.
      <br>
      <p>Both of these technologies are likely to be used concurrently as Cybersecurity is an issue that faces many challenges and new and innovative attacks arise everyday. However to be accurately identify which of these technologies will be more advanced can only be hypothesises at this juncture. In my assessment of both these processes, UBA do require a large investment in manpower, required for creating AI learning that is able to develop accurate and responsive alerts. However the ROI(return on investment) for this will be quite significant as once the system is able to process the data under unsupervised conditions then this will remarkably reduce the need for manual oversight.
Whereas the embedded authenticators will require new hardware to be created for every system, in order to develop and utilise the technology as a security measure against unwarranted attacks against sites and networks. And therefore it will be beneficial to develop new hardware with embedded authenticators, that is much more difficult to replicate than constantly develop new software to withstand cyber warfare.
      <br>
      <p>The user based Behavioural analytic technology will require many teams to initially ascertain which data parameters need to be set in order to input data collection, then analyse the user’s online behaviour and usage patterns and this will lead to the program issuing warnings for any unregistered use. Commonly UBA(User Behaviour Analytics) is supervised arena for AI learning, due to the nature of the data that is being collected, in order to contain any error in classification. However investing in UBA will promote unsupervised learning to extend the findings and therefore this can then be further explored by AI as this adds a significant demand as it will certainly increase the automation of the program. And thereby maybe more efficient in identifying the “unknown unknowns”.  (Security on Demand, 2021)
The Embedded authenticators are currently developed mainly by Intel and as such, this will in future be produced on a large-scale basis. This technology will provide immutable device identity and hence also include anti-tamper methodologies, including an integrated key(secure – storage), MFA and encryption for hardware loading.(Tech Monitor 2019) As this is a mixed technology which utilises both software and hardware authentication to delivery a safer alternate against cyber warfare, this allows the unrestricted key to be public, as long as the restricted key is kept private, in an embedded system in the peripheral. By employing this practice the accessory or peripheral(Tech Monitor 2019) is genuine and unquestionable within a given system.
      <br>
      <p>A potential impact of increased Cybersecurity across platforms using multiple sources of defence may lead to reduced phishing attacks, reduced ransomware attacks and network outage due to large scale cyber attacks. A potential area of concern in reference to Behaviour Analytics is also the increased risk in data leaks that may arise from the collection of large scale data storing, leading to more incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica Scandal(The New York Times, 2018).
While there is relief when considering the Embedded Authenticators as they require software-to-hardware authentication (Intel 2021), therefore any attack on the host will be in turn be fruitless, thus essentially making the system resistant to any attack.

A likely change that may arise as a result of the User Behavioural Analytics there will be an increase in predictive softwares and lack of any real privacy online. This may lead to users actively switching off from online services where possible, and or create multiple accounts or fake id’s to circumvent the analysis, which can lead to corrupted data, and there by create false warning and thus making the technology redundant. However it will also benefit it reducing effectiveness of the current the malware softwares, although it is vital to note that hackers may begin to utilise the same technology to gather user data. Similarly the requirement of new technology such as embedded authenticators will become a concern as new systems will need to purchased and older units will no longer be viable. As compared to software updates which do not require any additional hardware to be purchased the, the initial cost of the new technology will leave users reluctant to update their systems.
This will create vulnerabilities for those are technologically challenged, as they may still retain order systems as well as be more susceptible to malicious attacks, as they may choose not to update their computers and other hardware.
In terms of Behaviour Analysis for Cybersecurity, when the AI begins to learn under unsupervised conditions, there will be a massive redundancy of software programmers who had previously worked in areas such as security and software development for firewall and similar fields. This will lead to more systems being automated and thus less jobs and manpower will be needed.
But a possible increase in jobs may occur in creating embedded hardwares, and as such may lead to a demand for manpower in that area.
      <br>
      <p>Both User based Behaviour Analytics and Embedded Authenticators will certainly bring about new challenges in my day to day life. For instance if the data is being collected cross-platform, it will make it near impossible for me and others to have any privacy digitally. This collection of data maybe used by government agencies to help prevent cyber attacks but may also target citizens based on their political differences and can lead to large scale monitoring of private citizens. This is an issue that of grave concern especially in countries where citizens are already targeted based on their posts on social media. If private or government agencies were to have unrestricted access to raw data containing sensitive and identifiable data, this may lead to the rise of authoritative governance.
While if users forget the MFA(multi factor authentication) codes they maybe left unable to access their systems and this might lead to complete freezing or factory resetting of their they computers and other hardware systems.
However when it comes how this may affect me personally, although I understand theoretically if the system is used solely in the way its designed without any corruption to the process it will increase the safety aspect of platforms, from malicious cyber attacks, I will be concerned for how the data that is collected maybe used and how it may affect me in other arenas of my life. But when I think about older relatives or even young children who maybe more naive online, both these technologies would be advantageous as they can stop any malicious attacks, or accounts hacks and generally provide an overall safer online browsing experience. Although the constant updating of hardware may become a new norm and that might be a costly option.
I am keenly looking forward seeing how these new technologies will evolve and become utilised in our lives both on a small scale and in a large scale.
      <br>
      <h3>Clouds</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Clouds enable users to access any file, images and contents on any device with an Internet connection. For instance, a person is typing a report in Words on their computer at office and then clouds allow the person to make edits on their phone while going home. Also you can see your drawings that you drew on your iPad on your iPhone as well because of Apple icloud. In addition to this, Google Drive, Dropbox and Netflix are examples of cloud services which are used in our daily life.

The 2021 trend of cloud computing results show that enterprises continue to embrace multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies and are increasing spend with vendors across the board, citing a higher-than-expected cloud usage due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions throughout 2020(Luxner, 2021). Through cloud technology, a faster disaster recovery solution from different physical locations is provided with cost effectiveness. Besides features of cloud computing include Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), hybrid cloud, geo cloud, big data analytics and data storage & backup.

Autonomous driving as known as self-driving car is one of the prospective technologies for upcoming future and computing clouds is the key for the success of Autonomous Vehicles. The titans of automotive and digital worlds have begun aligning to create the cloud-based digital backbones that will enable AVs to operate safely on real roads and in real time(SEREDYNSKI, 2021). In detail, as there’s no human-driver, data such as current location of a car, traffic line, tunnel, bridge, traffic signs & signals, new path, road under construction must be updated in real time for the car to drive itself safely. Moreover, location information based service like a carpark near the destination, service station with the lowest price, available electronic vehicle charging station, fancy restaurants with great reviews etc are needed for the convenience for a driver and cloud computing will enable all of these services and contents.

To understand how cloud computing works, it can be divided into front-end and backend. The front end enables a user to access data stored in the cloud using an internet browser or a cloud computing software. However, the primary component of cloud computing – responsible for securely storing data and information – is the backend. It comprises servers, computers, databases, and central servers. The central server facilitates operations by following a set of rules known as protocols. It uses a software, middleware, to ensure seamless connectivity between devices/computers linked via cloud computing. Cloud computing service providers usually maintain multiple copies of the data to mitigate instances of security threats, data loss, data breach, etc(How Does Cloud Computing Work? | HCL Technologies, n.d.).

As mentioned above, it is used everyday and the impact of could technology is substantial. The potential impact of development of cloud technology will be autonomous driving and the innovative technology will impact everyone’s life a lot. It is assumed that car users will be most affected both positively and negatively. It will be positive to people who drive themselves to get to their office as they can have more time in their car, not driving. However it will be negative to people who drive for their life including taxi, bus, subway, train and boat driver and even pilots. Those jobs will be replaced by robotic drivers since more accurate and safer driving will be implemented by the technologies. Also this will create new jobs to manage, maintain and evolve the system and it is expected that the future employees for these jobs are required to have high level of knowledge and education.

This will affect me to be interested in jobs related to clouds and focus on the specific area to develop the required skills. It absolutely will help me to save lots of time to drive, park and find routes in my daily life. As my goal is working at a company that provides cloud service, knowing technical knowledge and latest issues & trends will be different from others. When the autonomous driving technology reaches the level of a zero defect, it will remove fears of falling asleep at the wheel, drunk driving, hit-and-run, getting lost and any car accident from the community of course including my family members and friends.
