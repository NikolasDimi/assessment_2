      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>What went well</strong></h4>
      <p>Overall, our team works well together, we have had great input from everyone on the team along with great collaboration. The team culture fun and everyone is a team player. We all used our strong skills in the assessment to bind together and get the work done. With consistent communication we were able to succeed.</p>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>What could be improved</strong></h4>
      <p></p>The team was formed only two weeks before the due date of assignment 2 submission and in addition to this, a half of team members, four people were not shown at all. We were trying to reach them but it was not possible and eventually there wasn’t enough time to have meetings, research and get feedback. So it could be improved by forming and contacting team members earlier like four weeks before the due date and also letting students know any updated information that the unreachable students withdraw the course or they’re absent for their personal reasons.

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong></h4>
      <p>A thing I found quite surprising is how well we were able to work with one, as a team. I found it quite surprising as we are located in different places and different groups and have never met previously or interacted with each other at any point prior to being auto-allocated into groups. I found this to be a very positive aspect of our entire team. And I truly found the coordination and the ability work well with each other to be remarkable. I found that we were all able to work autonomously but were able to bring together our ideas and develop them into a complete project in such a short span of time to be incredible. Especially since we had a hard time contacting the other members who were also auto-allocated and thus delaying our starting till this week. But I am amazed at how well we were able to coordinate and carry out the work without any hesitation or resistance. This has been one of the best experiences of group work for me. Each individual of the team was able to dedicate their time and effort to develop the project in the best possible way they can, while assisting each other, and making use of the strong suite of every active member.</p>
