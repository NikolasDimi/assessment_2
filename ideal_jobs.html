      <p>According to the data provided by Burning Glass, the three highest ranked general skills are communication skills, problem solving and organisational skills.
        Those three skills are all required for the chosen ideal job, cloud engineer.
        SQL, JavaScript and Java which are essential languages for cloud engineering are the three highest ranked IT specific skills.
        Overall, all of the top ranked skills are also required for cloud engineer respectively.
        Through having a look at the Burning Glass data, my opinion regarding the ideal job is ensured.
        It was able to be checked that the ideal job I chose has a high demand in the IT industry and top ranked skills are the same as the cloud engineer requires.</p>
