      <p></p>
      <p></p>I don’t think the audit trail on GitHub accurately reflects the work done by the group. I would goes as far as saying it doesn’t reflect it at all. The reason for this is as simple as it was easier for only one person to be involved in updating the website. This is because editing someone else’s code becomes quite difficult when we collectively don’t have that great a skill set in terms of html and CSS. Also, because you run into the problem of people styles differing as well as the fact that in order to edit it well, at least for us. Would involve downloading the section, editing the persons part in and then reuploading. Doing this may result in the possible removal of someone’s work should someone download a version prior to them editing, and then submit that copy without the other persons edit. Basically, not exactly the greatest idea for people new to this sort of stuff. There’s probably some way around this that I’m or my group is unaware of. But that’s kinda the problem.
