      <p>I’m Dan, I’m 36 and live in Williamstown Victoria, S3921231@student.rmit.edu.au. I haven’t studied since high school of 2005, so this transition has not only been a learning experience but also has been overwhelming to get back into studying and the workload required. However, in saying that I feel this will not only be a positive experience but also a good chance to gain new skills.
I’m a lover of dogs, cooking or both together…

          <br>I’ve always been capability of IT and my interest started since before I can remember. My first computer was before the age 5, playing computer games in dos. Although I don’t possess any formal IT training, I’ve been self-taught on what I do know.
I decided to study with RMIT as it’s a technology-based university which has a good reputation, furthermore, RMIT relationships to leading industry companies for placements and experience.
I’m interested in learning the web side of IT and gaining experience in web design and mobile applications as I believe they are the future.

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Team Profile:</strong></h4>
      <p>I’m the Protagonist the Extraverted, intuitive, feeling and Judging personality trait. Although, I see these traitors as a very solitude in terms of teamwork. I’m really easy to get on with and very ideas forward kind of person. I’m an overachiever who isn’t always great and I do like my presentation to be perfect. Although in my working life, I am a leader and a pusher, and to get things done and get them done right. I understand that not everyone will be on the same page as me. I’m okay with that, I overthink everything and go too much into it, when I should just take my time and work at it steady.</p>

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Personal Information:</strong></h4>
      <p>My name is Nikolas Dimitrakopoulos. My student number is S3924019. I was born and raised in Australia. Some of my hobbies include gaming, philosophy and soccer.
        My interest in IT would generally be the ways in which it can make everyday life easier/better. I currently have no IT experience other than the course I’m currently taking.</p>

      <p>Test Results:</p>
      <br>
      <p>Myers-Briggs Test Result: Logician INTP-A
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: According to these test results, I have a score of 79% in favor of introversion on the introverted/extraverted scale.
        Accuracy aside, this could affect my participation in group work or just engagement in general.
        With this in mind, it’s better that I make a conscious decision to communicate with the group more than I would otherwise like to.
      <br>
      <p>Learning Styles Test Result: Visual
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: According to these test results, I am a visual learner.
        This would indicate that it may be better for me to receive/learn new information visually rather than auditorily or kinesthetically.
        However, I hold the belief that what it is that I’m trying to learn has more of an impact on my “preferred learning style” than what on average is my preferred learning style.
        An example of this would be learning to speak a new language. I think that hearing the language being spoken would be preferable to visually seeing it, whether that be written or spoken.
        Knowing this, it shouldn’t be that important in terms of being useful to the group. Although it could be the case that if the average bit of new information is presented in a visual format.
        It may improve my learning process in some metric.
      <br>
      <p>Creativity test Result: 57.94 (out of what, I have no clue)
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: Unfortunately, these test results don’t exactly explain what the score means. However, it did provide a graph with at least something that can be used. It shows that both connection and boldness seem to be lower compared to the others. This suggests I’m less able to form connections between strange things (yes this is from the site) and lack the confidence to push boundaries. I believe that knowing this information will be of no use to the group because I think the information is inaccurate.

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Personal Information:</strong></h4>
      <p>I am Priya Mathew, currently I am studying at RMIT and my student ID is s3925824 and my email id is: s3925824@student.rmit.edu.au. A curious fascination of mine has been the digital world I am an active participant in. I have always been intrigued by how efficiently and effectively the world of IT works, and wished to be an active contributor to it. The idea of data analytics, especially of how the everyday data that has been collected “voluntarily” from customers like me through our daily interactions online, is then being used by large and small enterprises to determine marketing strategies, research policies and even develop prediction softwares that can accurately analyse how we will vote. This curiosity has led me to seek out  a career in IT, and has also influenced my approach to IT, and has been the key determinant in cultivating my interest in pursuing this subject academically, even though I only possess limited prior experience with Information Technology overall.(Mathew,P 2021)</p>
      <br>
      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Team Profile:</strong></h4>
      <p>Myers-Briggs test: ENFP-A, this results identifies my personality to possess strong people skills,
 and as such I will be able to utilise this skills in communicating my ideas within my team effectively,  while actively listening to the inputs from my team members and building a suitable solution that satisfies the demands of the work and team.  Whereas the Learning Styles Test displays that I show equal amount of importance to both the activist style, at the same time also portraying an equal strength in the reflector style,  this had made me understand that I am able to show leadership qualities when needed,  but also show empathy in regards to the ideas presented by others. This I believe will be beneficial in keeping a healthy dynamics between members of different temperaments in a team environment. And the Verbal Reasoning Test indicates that I tend to excel in accurately reviewing verbal data and coming to logical conclusions. These assessments have aided me in reflecting about my own work style and form an idea that I work well with others of differing working styles. Considering the results of my assessments it indicates that I can be pragmatic and also am someone who can enthusiastically adapt to a team of individuals of varying personalities. However, I will most likely work best with other individuals who are able to work autonomously with their specific tasks, yet are also able to contribute equally in collectively building ideas.

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Personal Information:</strong></h4>
      <p>I am Tae Yoon Park and in a group named Burning Apple. My student number is s3766070 and email address is s3766070@student.rmit.edu.au. I was in New Zealand last year but the Covid-19
 situation brought me in Korea at the moment. My nationality is Korea and I’m speaking Korean at home. I'm currently into cycling and a goal for 2021 is learning boxing or snowboarding. I’m quite scared of learning snowboarding because I’ve heard that it is easy to be injured when learning it.
My interest in IT started from high school. IT start-ups were a thing and I was told jobs related to IT have good prospects for future. Also I watched a comedy drama named Silicon Valley which is about five programmers struggling in Silicon Valley. It not only made me laugh a lot but also gave a basic information about starting IT based business and living in Silicon Valley. My current interests in IT are regarding clouds, data, IoT and quality assurance and I expect my future job to be related to them.

      <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>Team Profile:</strong></h4>
      <p>Through the results of tests, I could see myself objectively. For instance, I never thought myself to be traditional and conventional. After the result of Factor V of Big Five Personality Test, I asked myself and realised I sometimes tend to be tradition and conventional. But most of time I’m pretty open and like to experience.
According to my MBTI, I tend to be creative, imaginative and a good listener. These properties are essential when it comes to a teamwork and will help doing assignments in a team, minimising any conflicts. Also the emotional stability seen in results summary of Big Five Personality Test will help me to get through problems without serious mood swings when facing struggles.
By the results of a learning style test, I could find I’m lack of being a theorist compared to other styles. I would take the overall results account into doing this assignment, working effectively in a team and communicating with team members.
