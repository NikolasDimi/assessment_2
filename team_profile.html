      <h3>Nikolas</h3>
      <h4 style="color:red;">Personal Information</h4>
      <p>My name is Nikolas Dimitrakopoulos. My student number is S3924019.
        I was born and raised in Australia. Some of my hobbies include gaming, philosophy and soccer.
        My interest in IT would generally be the ways in which it can make everyday life easier/better.
        I currently have no IT experience other than the course I’m currently taking.</p>

      <p>Test Results</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Myers-Briggs Test Result: Logician INTP-A</strong></p>
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: According to these test results, I have a score of 79% in favor of introversion on the introverted/extraverted scale.
         Accuracy aside, this could affect my participation in group work or just engagement in general.
         With this in mind, it’s better that I make a conscious decision to communicate with the group more than I would otherwise like to.</p>
      <p><strong>Learning Styles Test Result: Visual</strong></p>
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: According to these test results, I am a visual learner.
         This would indicate that it may be better for me to receive/learn new information visually rather than auditorily or kinesthetically.
         However, I hold the belief that what it is that I’m trying to learn has more of an impact on my “preferred learning style” than what on average is my preferred learning style.
         An example of this would be learning to speak a new language. I think that hearing the language being spoken would be preferable to visually seeing it, whether that be written or spoken.
         Knowing this, it shouldn’t be that important in terms of being useful to the group. Although it could be the case that if the average bit of new information is presented in a visual format.
         It may improve my learning process in some metric.</p>
      <p><strong>Creativity test Result: 57.94 (out of what, I have no clue)</strong></p>
      <p>How it will be useful to the group: Unfortunately, these test results don’t exactly explain what the score means. However, it did provide a graph with at least something that can be used.
         It shows that both connection and boldness seem to be lower compared to the others.
         This suggests I’m less able to form connections between strange things (yes this is from the site) and lack the confidence to push boundaries.
         I believe that knowing this information will be of no use to the group because I think the information is inaccurate.</p>
      <h4 style="color:red;">Ideal Job</h4>
      <p>The chosen job was a unity game developer. Some of the skills necessary involve being good with unity, C# and being able to work well with other people involved with the project</p>
